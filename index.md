### Pipeline:
Multiple mutations at location 35 in chain A of protein 4BMB were evaluated using the Rosetta software package.

#### Documentation:
The structure 4BMB (Ruiz 2014) was acquired from the Protein Database. The Rosetta software package was used to create eleven mutations
at location 35 in chain A. These mutations were I35A, I35D, I35E, I35F, I35G, I35L, I35M, I35P, I35R, I35V, and I35Y. The native protein
and all mutations were optimized with Rosetta's Relax application (Nivón 2013) using the full atom and quick options. The energies of
these relaxed structures were calculated with Rosetta's Score application (O'Meara 2015). Full results are listed in
'4bmb_I35_mutation_scores.xlsx'.
